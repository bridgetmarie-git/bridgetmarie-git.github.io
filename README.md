### **Bio:**
   “Never, ever, ever give up.” – Michael Scott
   
   I am excited to learn more about designing mobile user interfaces and getting more experienced with GitHub.
   I enjoy being in nature and traveling. I like exploring botanical gardens and propagating my own little cactus plant collection at home.    My favorite tv show is The Office (origin of my motto choice).
